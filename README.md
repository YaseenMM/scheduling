# scheduling

To compile the program, type the following in the terminal when in the same directory as the lab2.java file:

javac lab2.java

To run the program, type the following:

java lab2 [Optional verbose tag] [Filename]

Optional verbose tag refers to the string "--verbose", which shows the individual cycles of the scheduler.

Filename refers to the input file which contains the processes. Note that both it and the "random-numbers" file must be present in the same 
directory as the lab2.java file for the program to run.

When inputting the Filename, do not use the extention (i.e. for input file input-1.txt, simply type input-1).
